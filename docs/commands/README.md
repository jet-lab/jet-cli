# Command Structure Overview

The root `jet` command of the Jet CLI does not hold any functionality of its own, but merely acts as a parent to parse the sub-commands provided in the command line to the proper handlers within the tool.

## Sub-commands

- [jet-airdrop](commands/airdrop.md) - Interacting with the governance airdrop mechanics
- [jet-auth](commands/auth.md) - Creating and managing governance authentication accounts
- [jet-margin](commands/margin.md) - Interacting with the various margin account programs
